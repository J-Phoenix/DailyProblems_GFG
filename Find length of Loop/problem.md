Given the head of a linked list, determine whether the list contains a loop. If a loop is present, return the number of nodes in the loop, otherwise return 0.

Note: Internally, pos(1 based index) is used to denote the position of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null, indicating there is no loop. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.<img width="603" height="497" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-06 at 4 41 41 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8df05ac6-cddc-45a8-84ed-8eedeeaa9685" />
